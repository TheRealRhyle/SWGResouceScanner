At this time it seems that Galaxy Harvester will not accept the submit data in headers or in a data package json.

Data is parsed from the image (move the examine window to the top left corner), converted to text, and dumped into a json file.

Data is also formatted as a form response and submitted via the postResources.py page of Galaxy Harvester.
